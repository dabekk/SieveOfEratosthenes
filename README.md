Cool Graphical Program + Algorithm
User types in a number and a graphical display of ordered boxes containing those numbers appears.
Then the program activates and all the non prime numbers begin to change colour one by one. Divisibles of 2 change into one colour, 3 a different colour and so on.
All the prime numbers who's boxes did not turn colour are then displayed on the right side of the screen.
The visual effect is very satisfying to watch.
